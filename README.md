# RandomWalk-and-Polymer
This project simulates the behavior of polymer molecules using the Freely Jointed Chain (FJC) model, representing polymers as a series of rigid segments connected by flexible joints. The goal is to understand the statistical properties and dynamics of polymers through random walk and FJC simulations, visualizations, and force-extension analysis.
